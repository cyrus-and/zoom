# Zoom

This minor mode takes care of managing the window sizes by enforcing a fixed and automatic balanced layout where the currently selected window is resized according to `zoom-size` which can be an absolute value in lines/columns, a ratio between the selected window and frame size or even a custom callback.

## Installation

### [MELPA] package

```
M-x package-install RET zoom
```

[MELPA]: https://melpa.org/#/getting-started

### Local package

```
M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/zoom.el
```

### Manual

```el
(require 'zoom "/path/to/zoom.el")
```

## Usage

Enable Zoom with `M-x zoom-mode` otherwise use `M-x zoom` to manually rearrange windows just once.

Load it automatically with:

```el
(custom-set-variables
 '(zoom-mode t))
```

See the [FAQ].

## Example configurations

For a complete reference see `M-x customize-group RET zoom`.

---

Resize the selected window using the [golden ratio]:

```el
(custom-set-variables
 '(zoom-size '(0.618 . 0.618)))
```

---

Resize the selected window according to the frame width, for example:

- 90 columns and 75% of the frame height if the frame width is larger than 1024 pixels;
- half the frame size otherwise.

```el
(defun size-callback ()
  (cond ((> (frame-pixel-width) 1280) '(90 . 0.75))
        (t                            '(0.5 . 0.5))))

(custom-set-variables
 '(zoom-size 'size-callback))
```

---

Override the key binding of `balance-windows`:

```el
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x +") 'zoom)
```

---

Prevent some windows from being resized, for example:

- `dired` and `markdown` major modes;
- `zoom.el` `init.el` buffer names;
- calculator-related windows;
- any buffer containing less than 20 lines.

```el
(custom-set-variables
 '(zoom-ignored-major-modes '(dired-mode markdown-mode))
 '(zoom-ignored-buffer-names '("zoom.el" "init.el"))
 '(zoom-ignored-buffer-name-regexps '("^*calc"))
 '(zoom-ignore-predicates '((lambda () (> (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)) 20)))))
```

(Please note that ignored windows are not resized when selected but all the windows are nevertheless arranged with `balance-windows`.)

## FAQ

### What about [`golden-ratio.el`]?

I have been a more or less happy [`golden-ratio.el`] user for some time when I stared noticing some bugs and sadly I discovered that it is apparently a dead project now, so I decided to write a new and improved minor mode from scratch that implements the same basic idea of automatic window layout as my first attempt at Emacs mode development.

[`golden-ratio.el`]: https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el

### Why when there are several horizontal splits the completions buffer is very small?

This happens when `zoom-minibuffer-preserve-layout` is non-`nil` (the default) because most of the space is probably occupied by the zoomed window. The solution (apart from setting the aforementioned variable to `nil`) is to enable the `temp-buffer-resize-mode` minor mode:

```el
(custom-set-variables
 '(temp-buffer-resize-mode t))
```

### Why windows are resized even when they are ignored?

When a window is ignored it is simply not resized when the user selects it.

In order to maintain a *stable* layout, windows are always balanced, then the selected window, unless ignored, is zoomed according to the user preference.

This may cause weird layouts with windows that are designed to be *small*, e.g., `imenu-list`. Unfortunately there is no universal solution to this.

The workaround is to set `window-size-fixed` to `t` for the buffers whose window must preserve the current size, for example the following fixes the size of the [`imenu-list`] window to 30 columns:

```el
(defun my/fix-imenu-size ()
  (with-selected-window (get-buffer-window "*Ilist*")
    (setq window-size-fixed t)
    (window-resize (selected-window) (- 30 (window-total-width)) t t)))

(add-hook 'imenu-list-update-hook 'my/fix-imenu-size)
```
